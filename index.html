                            I signed up for</span> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 <span>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.

                        I needed</span> some structure from professionals <span>who can help me learn programming</span> step by step.
                        I was encouraged to <span>enroll by a former student of theirs</span> who can only say wonderful things <span>about the program.
                        The entire</span> curriculum and staff did not <span>disappoint.
                        They were very hands-on</span> and I never had to wait long for <span>assistance.
                            The agile team project, in</span> particular, was outstanding.
                        It took <span>my learning to the next level in a way</span> that no tutorial could ever have.
                        In <span>fact, I've often referred to it during</span> interviews as an example of my <span>development experience.
                        It certainly</span> helped me land a job as a full-stack <span>developer after receiving multiple</span> offers. 100% recommend!"
